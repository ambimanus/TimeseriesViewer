# TimeseriesViewer
Plotting tool for time series data, written in Java.

The tool can import time series data from different electrical and thermal measuring sensors, including:
* CR Magnetics CRD5110 Single Element, 2-Wire Multifunction Digital Transducer
* Voltcraft Temperature & Humidity Data Logger

This is part of my masters thesis project, the topic was "modelling and evaluation of desynchronization strategies for controllable cooling devices".

Beware, this is from 2008 :)
